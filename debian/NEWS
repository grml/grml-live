grml-live (0.51.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The location of the FAI configuration data has changed, and all users
  who do not use the default configuration data must update their
  configuration.

  In the Debian package, the configuration data files were previously
  installed into /etc/grml/fai/config. To avoid continuous upgrading
  headaches, these files are now installed into
    /usr/share/grml-live/config
  instead.
  If you intend to modify them, it is strongly recommended to copy the
  entire directory tree into a new place of your choice (suggestion:
    /srv/grml-live-config)
  and modify them there.
  Alternatively you're encouraged to maintain your changes as a git
  patch stack.

  GRML_FAI_CONFIG (equivalent to passing -D) now must point to the
  "config" directory. For example, if you previously set
  GRML_FAI_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config/fai, then you must now set
  GRML_FAI_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config/fai/config.

  If you are running grml-live from a git checkout, GRML_FAI_CONFIG
  needs to be set to GRML_FAI_CONFIG=$(pwd)/config. Previously,
  this was GRML_FAI_CONFIG=$(pwd)/etc/grml/fai.

  fai.conf is no longer read. If your customized configuration
  includes fai.conf, you should delete it.

  If you run into trouble, please reach out:
    https://grml.org/contact/
  As always we are also open to providing commercial support.

grml-live (0.17.0) unstable; urgency=low

  1) The sources.list handling has been further improved and
  better integrated, config variable $GRML_LIVE_SOURCES has gone.

  2) This release provides initial support for generating netboot
  packages during build process (enabled by default).

  3) If the according dependencies are available (xorriso
  >=1.1.6-1 on buildsystem, grub-efi-amd64-bin inside chroot and
  building using AMD64 class) then the ISOs provide initial UEFI
  support.

  4) For better integration with Jenkins a report of missing
  packages in xunit format is generated and new options -A (for
  ensuring clean builds and pack artifacts), -T (for unpacking
  chroot archives) and -U (to ensure output files ownership) has
  been introduced.

  5) Using the SOURCES class provides support to retrieve Debian
  package sources in the build process.

grml-live (0.15.0) unstable; urgency=low

  1) The new command line option -D supports setting a
  configuration directory instead of /etc/grml/fai. This is
  the same as setting GRML_FAI_CONFIG.

  2) Removed /etc/grml/fai/apt/sources.list, thanks to a redesign
  of sources.list handling which provides a more consistent
  approach. /etc/apt/sources.list will no longer use entries from
  GRML_LIVE_SOURCES once the system has been initially installed.
  Now handling of sources.list works as follows:

  ${GRML_FAI_CONFIG}/config/files/etc/apt/sources.list/GRML_LIVE_SOURCES_LIST
  is generated based on $GRML_LIVE_SOURCES (if set by the user,
  otherwise falling back to Grml repositories plus Debian).  This
  GRML_LIVE_SOURCES_LIST file then gets deployed on *fresh*
  deployments. It won't be installed again when running grml-live
  -u.  This provides more flexibility combined with a more
  transparent and consistent behaviour for the user.

  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list will be set up based on the
  detected Debian suite and the files from
  ${GRML_FAI_CONFIG}/config/files/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list/DEBIAN_*.

  /etc/apt/sources.list/grml-stable.list will be deployed and
  (depending on the build type) also
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml-testing.list might be installed.

grml-live (0.9.35) unstable; urgency=low

  The files from /etc/grml/fai/files have been moved to
  /etc/grml/fai/config/files (and as a consequence
  /etc/grml/fai/live-initramfs has been moved to
  /etc/grml/fai/config/ as well). This is an important step
  to use the config space and class concept of FAI in a more
  decent and clean way. It allows much better customization.

  Please notice: If you didn't modify anything inside
  /etc/grml/fai/files you can safely remove the directory.
  Otherwise please check out the structure of the new
  /etc/grml/fai/config/files layout and the fcopy command
  used in /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/* scripts to
  incoorporate your changes.

grml-live (0.9.34) unstable; urgency=low

  This version introduces an additional package named grml-live-db.
  The grml-live-db Debian package provides a simple way to put build
  information of grml-live into a database. By default you have to do
  nothing but install grml-live-db and during each invocation of
  grml-live you'll get an additional entry in the sqlite3 database
  /var/log/grml-live.db. If you want to customize the database logging
  check out the grml-live-db manpage.

  Instead of ZERO_LOGFILE a new variable titled PRESERVE_LOGFILE has
  been introduced. By default grml-live cleans the build logfile so
  grml-live-db can work straight out-of-the-box. If you still want to
  preserve your logfiles (e.g. when you don't want to use
  grml-live-db) just enable the PRESERVE_LOGFILE option in your
  grml-live configuration file.  For backwards compatibility reasons the
  ZERO_LOGFILE variable is still supported within grml-live but it's
  strongly recommended to adjust configuration.

grml-live (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  grml provides its own squashfs-tools again which support LZMA
  compression with kernel 2.6.26-grml[64], please install the
  Debian package squashfs-lzma-tools of the grml repository.
  More details can be found in the grml-live docs. Please
  check out the section "Current state of grml-live with
  squashfs-tools and kernel" in the grml-live docs, being
  shipped with this package as manpage grml-live(8) and
  /usr/share/doc/grml-live/grml-live.html and being available
  online at http://grml.org/grml-live/#current_state as well.

  grml migrated from Mercurial (hg) to Git as version control
  system. If you are interested in using very recent grml-live
  versions from our VCS please make sure to check out the docs.

grml-live (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  grml-live 0.9 features kernel 2.6.26-grml[64]. Using
  squashfs-tools 1:3.2r2-9exp1 does not work with kernel
  2.6.26-grml when using LZMA compression though it works
  fine when using ZLIB compression.

  Debian provides updated squashfs-tools 1:3.3-7. You can
  safely upgrade as long as you don't need kernel
  2.6.23-grml[64] and/or LZMA compression.

  All these details can be found in the grml-live docs. Please
  check out the section "Current state of grml-live with
  squashfs-tools and kernel" in the grml-live docs, being
  shipped with this package as manpage grml-live(8) and
  /usr/share/doc/grml-live/grml-live.html and being available
  online at http://grml.org/grml-live/#current_state as well.

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
  renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
  templates for building the ISO can be found.
  Do not forget to adjust present scripts you use with grml-live.

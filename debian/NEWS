grml-live (0.53.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  Class (option -c) handling has changed:

  - GRMLBASE and architecture-specific classes are now enabled by
    default and should be removed from your grml-live invocation.

  - The RELEASE class (which cleans up /root and /home/grml) is also
    automatically enabled and can be disabled using the new "-R"
    option.

  These changes simplify the build process by reducing the need for
  manual class specification in most common use cases.

  You should still specify GRML_SMALL or GRML_FULL and/or your custom
  classes.

grml-live (0.52.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  We replaced FAI with our own implementation minifai.  It should be
  backwards compatible, though if you notice any problems, please
  reach out (via https://github.com/grml/grml-live/issues or
  https://grml.org/contact/).

grml-live (0.51.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The location of the FAI configuration data has changed, and all users
  who do not use the default configuration data must update their
  configuration.

  In the Debian package, the configuration data files were previously
  installed into /etc/grml/fai/config. To avoid continuous upgrading
  headaches, these files are now installed into
    /usr/share/grml-live/config
  instead.
  If you intend to modify them, it is strongly recommended to copy the
  entire directory tree into a new place of your choice (suggestion:
    /srv/grml-live-config)
  and modify them there.
  Alternatively you're encouraged to maintain your changes as a git
  patch stack.

  GRML_FAI_CONFIG (equivalent to passing -D) now must point to the
  "config" directory. For example, if you previously set
  GRML_FAI_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config/fai, then you must now set
  GRML_FAI_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config/fai/config.

  If you are running grml-live from a git checkout, GRML_FAI_CONFIG
  needs to be set to GRML_FAI_CONFIG=$(pwd)/config. Previously,
  this was GRML_FAI_CONFIG=$(pwd)/etc/grml/fai.

  fai.conf is no longer read. If your customized configuration
  includes fai.conf, you should delete it.

  If you run into trouble, please reach out:
    https://grml.org/contact/
  As always we are also open to providing commercial support.

grml-live (0.17.0) unstable; urgency=low

  1) The sources.list handling has been further improved and
  better integrated, config variable $GRML_LIVE_SOURCES has gone.

  2) This release provides initial support for generating netboot
  packages during build process (enabled by default).

  3) If the according dependencies are available (xorriso
  >=1.1.6-1 on buildsystem, grub-efi-amd64-bin inside chroot and
  building using AMD64 class) then the ISOs provide initial UEFI
  support.

  4) For better integration with Jenkins a report of missing
  packages in xunit format is generated and new options -A (for
  ensuring clean builds and pack artifacts), -T (for unpacking
  chroot archives) and -U (to ensure output files ownership) has
  been introduced.

  5) Using the SOURCES class provides support to retrieve Debian
  package sources in the build process.

grml-live (0.15.0) unstable; urgency=low

  1) The new command line option -D supports setting a
  configuration directory instead of /etc/grml/fai. This is
  the same as setting GRML_FAI_CONFIG.

  2) Removed /etc/grml/fai/apt/sources.list, thanks to a redesign
  of sources.list handling which provides a more consistent
  approach. /etc/apt/sources.list will no longer use entries from
  GRML_LIVE_SOURCES once the system has been initially installed.
  Now handling of sources.list works as follows:

  ${GRML_FAI_CONFIG}/config/files/etc/apt/sources.list/GRML_LIVE_SOURCES_LIST
  is generated based on $GRML_LIVE_SOURCES (if set by the user,
  otherwise falling back to Grml repositories plus Debian).  This
  GRML_LIVE_SOURCES_LIST file then gets deployed on *fresh*
  deployments. It won't be installed again when running grml-live
  -u.  This provides more flexibility combined with a more
  transparent and consistent behaviour for the user.

  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list will be set up based on the
  detected Debian suite and the files from
  ${GRML_FAI_CONFIG}/config/files/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list/DEBIAN_*.

  /etc/apt/sources.list/grml-stable.list will be deployed and
  (depending on the build type) also
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml-testing.list might be installed.

grml-live (0.9.35) unstable; urgency=low

  The files from /etc/grml/fai/files have been moved to
  /etc/grml/fai/config/files (and as a consequence
  /etc/grml/fai/live-initramfs has been moved to
  /etc/grml/fai/config/ as well). This is an important step
  to use the config space and class concept of FAI in a more
  decent and clean way. It allows much better customization.

  Please notice: If you didn't modify anything inside
  /etc/grml/fai/files you can safely remove the directory.
  Otherwise please check out the structure of the new
  /etc/grml/fai/config/files layout and the fcopy command
  used in /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/* scripts to
  incoorporate your changes.

grml-live (0.9.34) unstable; urgency=low

  This version introduces an additional package named grml-live-db.
  The grml-live-db Debian package provides a simple way to put build
  information of grml-live into a database. By default you have to do
  nothing but install grml-live-db and during each invocation of
  grml-live you'll get an additional entry in the sqlite3 database
  /var/log/grml-live.db. If you want to customize the database logging
  check out the grml-live-db manpage.

  Instead of ZERO_LOGFILE a new variable titled PRESERVE_LOGFILE has
  been introduced. By default grml-live cleans the build logfile so
  grml-live-db can work straight out-of-the-box. If you still want to
  preserve your logfiles (e.g. when you don't want to use
  grml-live-db) just enable the PRESERVE_LOGFILE option in your
  grml-live configuration file.  For backwards compatibility reasons the
  ZERO_LOGFILE variable is still supported within grml-live but it's
  strongly recommended to adjust configuration.

grml-live (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  grml provides its own squashfs-tools again which support LZMA
  compression with kernel 2.6.26-grml[64], please install the
  Debian package squashfs-lzma-tools of the grml repository.
  More details can be found in the grml-live docs. Please
  check out the section "Current state of grml-live with
  squashfs-tools and kernel" in the grml-live docs, being
  shipped with this package as manpage grml-live(8) and
  /usr/share/doc/grml-live/grml-live.html and being available
  online at https://grml.org/grml-live/#current_state as well.

  grml migrated from Mercurial (hg) to Git as version control
  system. If you are interested in using very recent grml-live
  versions from our VCS please make sure to check out the docs.

grml-live (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  grml-live 0.9 features kernel 2.6.26-grml[64]. Using
  squashfs-tools 1:3.2r2-9exp1 does not work with kernel
  2.6.26-grml when using LZMA compression though it works
  fine when using ZLIB compression.

  Debian provides updated squashfs-tools 1:3.3-7. You can
  safely upgrade as long as you don't need kernel
  2.6.23-grml[64] and/or LZMA compression.

  All these details can be found in the grml-live docs. Please
  check out the section "Current state of grml-live with
  squashfs-tools and kernel" in the grml-live docs, being
  shipped with this package as manpage grml-live(8) and
  /usr/share/doc/grml-live/grml-live.html and being available
  online at https://grml.org/grml-live/#current_state as well.

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
  renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
  templates for building the ISO can be found.
  Do not forget to adjust present scripts you use with grml-live.

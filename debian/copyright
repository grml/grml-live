   SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
   -----------------------------------------------------------

   PREAMBLE
   The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
   development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
   efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
   open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
   with others.

   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
   names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
   requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
   to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

   Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

      CHEATCODES AND HINTS FOR GRML
==============================================================================

Isolinux bootprompt options:
----------------------------

These options work from the isolinux bootprompt of Grml based (live) systems.
(Do NOT use them as 'grml $OPTION', use them as '$OPTION'!):

grml                                  Use default settings (same as just pressing return)
grml2ram                              Copy Grml's squashfs file to RAM and
                                      run from there (compare with 'grml toram')
memtest                               Run Memtest86+ instead of Linux
fb1280x1024                           Use fixed framebuffer graphics (1)
fb1024x768                            Use fixed framebuffer graphics (2) [notice: Grml's default]
fb800x600                             Use fixed framebuffer graphics (3)
nofb                                  Disable framebuffer
floppy                                Boot from primary floppy drive
hd / hd1 /hd2 / hd3                   Boot from first .. fourth primary partition of (local) harddisk
hd0 / fd0                             Chainload MBR from first harddisk / floppy drive
debug                                 Be verbose during the process of booting for debugging
forensic                              Do not touch any harddisks during hardware recognition
serial                                Activate ttyS0 and start a getty
hdt                                   Boot Hardware Detection Tool (from syslinux project)

Further documentation regarding the boot process can be found at:

* https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Doc/chain + https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Comboot/chain.c32

The following boot options can be combined.
Notice: not all of them are available on all the Grml flavours.
For example the X window system is not part of grml-small.

Regional settings:
------------------

grml lang=at|ch|de|de-neo|es|fr       Specify language ($LANG, $LC_ALL, $LANGUAGE) + keyboard
grml lang=hu|it|jp|uk|us|dvorak       Specify language ($LANG, $LC_ALL, $LANGUAGE) + keyboard
grml localtime                        Assume Hardware Clock (RTC) is set in localtime (default: RTC is in UTC)
grml tz=Europe/Vienna                 Use specified timezone for TZ, defaults to TZ=UTC
grml keyboard=us                      Use different keyboard layout (see list from lang=)

Configuration settings:
-----------------------
grml myconfig=/dev/fd0                Set the DCS dir (debs, config, scripts) to the root of this device
                                      DCS dir defaults to the live image or a device labeled GRMLCFG
                                      If a file /config.tbz exists, it is extracted from there.
                                      /dev/fd0  for floppy disk
                                      /dev/sda1 for USB-stick/first SCSI-device
grml autoconfig=SOMELABEL             Set the DCS dir to the root of the device labeled with SOMELABEL.
                                      If undefined search for a device labeled with GRMLCFG.
grml netconfig=server/config.tbz      Download file and extract configuration archive

grml file=foobar.tbz                  Use specified file as name for configuration archive
                                      instead of the default one (config.tbz)
grml extract=/etc                     Extract only /etc from configuration archive,
                                      use it in combination with myconfig or netconfig
grml persistence                      Enable persistency feature, more details available at
                                      https://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=persistency
grml hostname=...                     Set hostname to given argument
grml hostname                         Set a random hostname
grml nonetworking                     Do not create/overwrite /etc/network/interface during startup
grml distri=...                       Set distribution name to given argument. If a jpg file named like the
                                      given distri name can be found in directory desktop on the ISO
                                      (/cdrom/desktop/"$DISTRI") it will be taken as wallpaper for grml
grml debnet                           Search through local partitions for file /etc/network/interfaces,
                                      copy /etc/network to local system and restart networking then
grml dns=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4              Set DNS resolvers during boot and for live system.
grml ip=...                           Standard Linux kernel ip= boot option. Arguments:
                                      clientip:nfsserverip:gwip:netmask:hostname:device:autoconf
                                      Valid values for autoconf: off, on, dhcp, bootp, rarp, both.
                                      Almost everything is optional. Most common form: ip=dhcp
grml mypath=...                       Add specified option into $PATH of Zsh
                                      For example when using "grml mypath=/foobar" then /foobar
                                      will be added to the end of $PATH inside Zsh
grml debs                             Install all Debian packages from the "debs" directory of your DCS
                                      directory (see myconfig=, typically the root of your ISO image).
grml debs=path-name-wildcard          Install Debian packages from DCS directory (see myconfig=,
                                      typically the root of your ISO image). If path does not contain a
                                      "/" the package(s) will be installed from directory "debs" of the
                                      DCS directory instead.  The "path-name-wildcard" can contain
                                      wildcards (e.g. debs=rat* will install a packages starting with "rat"
                                      from directory debs/).
grml scripts=path-name                Execute script (defaulting to grml.sh) inside DCS dir. Path names
                                      allowed. If path-name points to a directory, all scripts found in
                                      the directory are executed.
grml config=path-name                 Unpack archive that path-name points to
grml noautoconfig                     Disable searching for device labeled GRMLCFG
grml nobeep                           Disable welcome chime, sounded before grml-quickconfig starts.

Notice: Take a look at https://grml.org/config/ and 'man 1 grml-autoconfig'
for more information regarding the configuration framework of Grml.

Booting related options:
------------------------
grml toram                            Copy the whole CD/medium to RAM and run from there
grml toram=filename.squashfs          Copy the specified file to RAM and run from there
                                      Usage example: grml toram=grml-medium.squashfs
                                      Notice: grml2ram is an alias for this option which
                                      corresponds with the grml flavour settings by default
grml bootfrom=/dev/sda1               Use the squashfs file from directory 'live' of the specified device
                                      Setup can be done by executing:
                                        rsync -a --progress /run/live/medium/live /media/sda1/
                                      NOTE: you can can also use bootfrom=/dev/disk/by-label/yourlabel
                                      (adjust yourlabel as needed), which should prevent choosing the
                                      wrong block device (e.g. if more than one disk is present).
grml bootfrom=removable               Restrict search for the live media to removable type only.
grml bootfrom=removable-usb           Restrict search for the live media to usb mass storage only.
grml isofrom=[fs:][/device]/grml.iso  Use specified ISO image for booting.
                                      Useful when booting as a rescue system from a different device.
                                      If you want to load the image from a device different from the root device
                                      specified through the bootloader, prefix its device path to the path, like
                                      in "/dev/sda1/grml.iso".
                                      Internally, the initrd will mount the given device, automatically detecting
                                      the file system.
                                      If needed, prefix the file system separated with a colon character to
                                      override the automatic detection, like in "ext4:/dev/sda1/grml.iso".
                                      As an example, boot the according grml kernel and initrd using the
                                      bootoptions "boot=live isofrom=btrfs:/dev/vda40/path/to/grml.iso"
                                      NOTE: "fromiso" does the same as "isofrom", it's just there
                                      to prevent any typing errors
                                      NOTE: you can can also use isofrom=/dev/disk/by-label/yourlabel
                                      (adjust yourlabel as needed), which should prevent choosing the
                                      wrong block device (e.g. if more than one disk is present).
grml findiso=/grml-....iso            Look for the specified ISO file on all disks where it usually
                                      looks for the .squashfs file (so you don't have to know the device name
                                      as in isofrom=....).
grml fetch=$IP/filename.squashfs      Download a squashfs image from a given url, copying to ram and booting it.
grml live-media-path=/live/grml...    Sets the path to the live filesystem on the medium
                                      By default, it is set to /live/$GRML_FLAVOUR/ (where $GRML_FLAVOUR
                                      is corresponding to grml64-full, grml32-full, grml64-small,...
                                      [Note: this parameter is mandatory]
grml module=grml                      Instead of using the default "$name.module" another file can
                                      be specified without the extension ".module"; it should be placed
                                      on "/live" directory of the live medium
                                      Useful for Multiboot USB pen, see
                                      https://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=tips#multiboot_usb_pen
grml bootid=mybootid                  Use specified argument as identifier for the ISO.
                                      mybootid is specified in /conf/bootid.txt on the ISO.
grml ignore_bootid                    Disable bootid verification.


Debugging related settings:
---------------------------
grml nocolor                          Disable colorized output while booting
                                      Also set SYSTEMD_COLORS=0 to disable colors in systemd output
grml log                              Log error messages while booting to /tmp/grml.log.`date +%Y%m%d`"
grml testcd                           Check CD data integrity and md5sums

grml passwd=...                       Set password for root & grml user
grml encpasswd=....                   Set specified hash as password for root & grml user, use e.g.
                                      'mkpasswd -H md5' to generate such a hash (available in Grml >=2013.09)

Service related settings:
-------------------------
grml startup=script                   Start $script instead of grml-quickconfig on startup
grml nogpm                            Disable GPM daemon
grml noblank                          Disable console blanking
grml noquick                          Disable grml-quickconfig startup script
grml services={espeakup,rpcbind,...}  Start system service(s)
grml welcome                          Welcome message via soundoutput

grml noprompt                         Do NOT prompt to remove the CD when halting/rebooting the system
grml startx{=windowmanager}           Start X window system automatically
grml nostartx                         If using startx as default bootoption the nostartx *disables* automatic
                                      startup of X again. (This bootoption is relevant for grml based derivatives
                                      which decide to enable startx by default only, plain grml does not use
                                      automatic startup of X by default.)
grml vnc=password                     Start VNC server with startup of X.org and sets the password to the specified
                                      one. To automatically start the VNC server use the startx bootoption.
                                      [Note: Grml 2011.12+ doesn't include a VNC server.]
grml vnc_connect=host[:port]          Connect to a listening VNC client ("vncviewer -listen" reverse connection).
                                      Can be used to connect from devices behind firewalls as connection is
                                      initiated from the VNC server instead of the VNC client. Has to be
                                      combined with the vnc bootoption.
                                      [Note: Grml 2011.12+ doesn't include a VNC client.]
grml getfile.retries=$NUM             Retry the download of the files specified in the netconfig=... +
                                      netscript=... options up to $NUM times

Additional notes:
-----------------

*) If your Grml-CD makes strange noises during boot, or you see frequent
errors like "squashfs: read error", or programs are crashing randomly,
then your CD image is probably defective or incomplete, your CD-burner
created a defective CD due to wrong writing speed or bad media or your
CD-ROM drive is broken. This is the most common error reported.  Please
boot with "grml testcd" to check if the CD is OK, and/or even better,
verify the MD5 checksums that are present on the mirrors before writing
the CD.  Check your CD low-level via running 'readcd -c2scan
dev=/dev/cdrom'. In some cases, defective IDE controllers cause this
error if you have DMA enabled. Also, please read the grml-FAQ.

*) In case of a failing hardware autodetection, try booting with any of
the "no-" options as shown in the table above, like in
   grml noagp noapic acpi=off nodma
to skip some critical parts of the autodetection system.

*) The "myconfig=/dev/partition" option allows you to reconfigure the
system after autoconfiguration by running a bourne shell script called
"grml.sh" and/or extracting configuration files from a file named
config.tbz from the root directory on the given device (or floppy).
Take a look at https://grml.org/config/ for more information regarding
the configuration framework of grml.

*) If you wish to remaster the CD, please don't forget to specify

        -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
        -b boot/grub/i386-pc/eltorito.img \
        --grub2-boot-info --grub2-mbr \
        /chroot/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/boot_hybrid.img

as option to mkisofs/xorriso. Otherwise your CD won't be bootable. The
directory live, containing the squashfs compressed filesystem file,
must be located in the top level directory of the CD.

*) Caution: screensavers: Don't start physlock or any other screensaver
that requires a password manually. There are no default passwords on
the live system - all accounts are LOCKED by default for security reasons.
Instead just invoke the script grml-lock which prompts for setting a
password.

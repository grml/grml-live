                                    DCS dir defaults to the live image or a device labeled GRMLCFG
                                    If a file /config.tbz exists, it is extracted from there.
                                    /dev/fd0  for floppy disk

                                    http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=persistency
                                    Notice that the "=nofiles" argument is optional, though recommended
                                    as default setting.
grml hostname=...                   Set hostname to given argument
grml hostname                       Set a random hostname

                                    given distri name can be found in directory desktop on the ISO
                                    (/cdrom/desktop/"$DISTRI") it will be taken as wallpaper for grml
grml debnet                         Search through local partitions for file /etc/network/interfaces,
                                    copy /etc/network to local system and restart networking then

                                    For example when using "grml mypath=/foobar" then /foobar
                                    will be added to the end of $PATH inside Zsh
grml debs                           Install all Debian packages from the "debs" directory of your DCS
                                    directory (see myconfig=, typically the root of your ISO image).
grml debs=path-name-wildcard        Install Debian packages from DCS directory (see myconfig=,
                                    typically the root of your ISO image). If path does not contain a
                                    "/" the package(s) will be installed from directory "debs" of the
				    DCS directory instead.  The "path-name-wildcard" can contain
				    wildcards (e.g. debs=rat* will install a packages starting with "rat"
				    from directory debs/).
grml scripts=path-name              Execute script (defaulting to grml.sh) inside DCS dir. Path names
                                    allowed. If path-name points to a directory, all scripts found in

                                    Usage example: grml toram=grml-medium.squashfs
                                    Notice: grml2ram is an alias for this option which
                                    corresponds with the grml flavour settings by default
grml tohd=/dev/sda1                 Copy Grml's squashfs file to harddisk partition for later
                                    use via "grml bootfrom=/dev/sda1"
grml bootfrom=/dev/sda1             Use the squashfs file from directory 'live' of the specified device
                                    Setup can be done booting 'grml tohd=/dev/sda1' or
                                    running 'rsync -a --progress /live/image/live /mnt/sda1/'
grml bootfrom=removable             Restrict search for the live media to removable type only.
grml bootfrom=removable-usb         Restrict search for the live media to usb mass storage only.

                                    Useful when booting as a rescue system from harddisk - just boot
                                    the according grml kernel and initrd using the bootoptions
                                    "boot=live isofrom=/dev/sda1/grml.iso"
                                    Notice: "fromiso" does the same as "isofrom", it's just there
                                    to prevent any typing errors
grml findiso=/grml_2010.12.iso      Look for the specified ISO file on all disks where it usually
                                    looks for the .squashfs file (so you don't have to know the device name
                                    as in isofrom=....).
grml fetch=$IP/filename.squashfs    Download a squashfs image from a given url, copying to ram and booting it.
                                    [Note: releases before 2011.05 didn't support DNS but IP only.]
grml live-media-path=live           Sets the path to the live filesystem on the medium
                                    By default, it is set to /live
grml module=grml                    Instead of using the default "$name.module" another file can
                                    be specified without the extension ".module"; it should be placed
                                    on "/live" directory of the live medium
                                    Useful for Multiboot USB pen, see
                                    http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=tips#multiboot_usb_pen
grml bootid=mybootid                Use specified argument as identifier for the ISO.
                                    mybootid is specified in /conf/bootid.txt on the ISO.
                                    [Note: only available since release 2010.04]
grml ignore_bootid                  Disable bootid verification.
                                    [Note: only available since release 2010.04]

                                    startup of X again. (This bootoption is relevant for grml based derivatives
                                    which decide to enable startx by default only, plain grml does not use
                                    automatic startup of X by default.)

Installation related settings:
------------------------------

Caution: do *NOT* use the grml2hd and/or debian2hd bootoption if you do not know what you are doing!

Install plain Debian via debian2hd bootoption (which runs grml-debootstrap in non-interactive mode):

debian2hd <options>                 ... whereas valid options for debian2hd are:

  target=       target partition/directory of the new Debian system, e.g.: target=/dev/sda1
  grub=         where to install grub to, e.g.: grub=/dev/sda
  release=      specify release of new Debian system (default is stable), e.g.: release=sid
  mirror=       specify mirror for apt-get/aptitude, e,g.: mirror=http://cdn.debian.net/debian
  password=     set passwort of user root without prompting for it, e.g.: password=AiTh5ahn

  Usage example for automatic installation:

    debian2hd target=/dev/sda1 grub=/dev/sda mirror=http://cdn.debian.net/debian password=foobar

  See http://grml.org/grml-debootstrap/ for more information.

Install grml via grml2hd bootoption (which runs grml2hd in non-interactive mode):

grml2hd <options>                   ... whereas valid options for grml2hd are:

   user=                user name for user which should be used at hd-install
   filesystem={ext2|ext3|reiserfs|reiser4|jfs|xfs}      filesystem to be used
   mbr=/dev/...  partition where MBR should be installed (default:=partition)
   partition=/dev/...                partition where grml should be installed

  Usage example for booting:
   grml2hd partition=/dev/sda4 mbr=/dev/sda filesystem=ext3 user=mika

  Passwords of user root and user are "grml" - please adjust after hd-install!

  See http://grml.org/grml2hd/ for more information.

Additional notes:
-----------------

*) If your Grml-CD makes strange noises during boot, or you see frequent
errors like "squashfs: read error", or programs are crashing randomly,
then your CD image is probably defective or incomplete, your CD-burner
created a defective CD due to wrong writing speed or bad media or your
CD-ROM drive is broken. This is the most common error reported.  Please
boot with "grml testcd" to check if the CD is OK, and/or even better,
verify the MD5 checksums that are present on the mirrors before writing
the CD.  Check your CD low-level via running 'readcd -c2scan
dev=/dev/cdrom'. In some cases, defective IDE controllers cause this
error if you have DMA enabled. Also, please read the grml-FAQ.

*) In case of a failing hardware autodetection, try booting with any of
the "no-" options as shown in the table above, like in
   grml noagp noapm noapic acpi=off nodma
to skip some critical parts of the autodetection system.

*) Some boards (especially those with E-ISA slots) apparently don't pass
the proper memory size to the linux-kernel. It may cause the message
"Panic: cannot mount root file system" and the system hangs. Use "grml
mem=128M" to solve that problem if your system has 128MByte memory for
example (caution: you MUST use a capital "M" here).

*) The "myconfig=/dev/partition" option allows you to reconfigure the
system after autoconfiguration by running a bourne shell script called
"grml.sh" and/or extracting configuration files from a file named
config.tbz from the root directory on the given device (or floppy).
Take a look at http://grml.org/config/ for more information regarding
the configuration framework of grml.

*) If you wish to remaster the CD, please don't forget to specify

        -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
        -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat

as option to mkisofs. Otherwise your CD won't be bootable. The
directory live, containing the squashfs compressed filesystem file,
must be located in the top level directory of the CD.

*) Caution: screensavers: Don't start vlock or any other screensaver
that requires a password manually. There are no default passwords on
the live system - all accounts are LOCKED by default for security reasons.
Instead just invoke the script grml-lock which prompts for setting a
password.

      CHEATCODES AND HINTS FOR GRML
==============================================================================

These options work from the (isolinux/grub) bootprompt of Grml based (live) systems.

The following kernel options are available (do NOT use them as 'grml $OPTION',
use them as '$OPTION'!):

grml distri=...                     Set distribution name to given argument. If a jpg file named like the
                                    given distri name can be found in directory desktop on the ISO
                                    (/cdrom/desktop/"$DISTRI") it will be taken as wallpaper for grml
grml debnet                         Search through local partitions for file /etc/network/interfaces,
                                    copy /etc/network to local system and restart networking then

grml mypath=...                     Add specified option into $PATH of Zsh
                                    For example when using "grml mypath=/foobar" then /foobar
                                    will be added to the end of $PATH inside Zsh
grml debs                           Install all Debian packages from the "debs" directory of your DCS
                                    directory (see myconfig=, typically the root of your ISO image).
grml debs=path-name-wildcard        Install Debian packages from DCS directory (see myconfig=,
                                    typically the root of your ISO image). If path does not contain a
                                    "/" the package(s) will be installed from directory "debs" of the
                                    DCS directory instead.  The "path-name-wildcard" can contain
                                    wildcards (e.g. debs=rat* will install a packages starting with "rat"
                                    from directory debs/).
grml scripts=path-name              Execute script (defaulting to grml.sh) inside DCS dir. Path names
                                    allowed. If path-name points to a directory, all scripts found in
                                    the directory are executed.
grml config=path-name               Unpack archive that path-name points to
grml noautoconfig                   Disable searching for device labeled GRMLCFG
grml nobeep                         Disable welcome chime, sounded before grml-quickconfig starts.

Notice: Take a look at http://grml.org/config/ and 'man 1 grml-autoconfig'
for more information regarding the configuration framework of Grml.

Booting related options:
------------------------
grml toram                          Copy the whole CD/medium to RAM and run from there
grml toram=filename.squashfs        Copy the specified file to RAM and run from there
                                    Usage example: grml toram=grml-medium.squashfs
                                    Notice: grml2ram is an alias for this option which
                                    corresponds with the grml flavour settings by default
grml tohd=/dev/sda1                 Copy Grml's squashfs file to harddisk partition for later
                                    use via "grml bootfrom=/dev/sda1"
grml bootfrom=/dev/sda1             Use the squashfs file from directory 'live' of the specified device
                                    Setup can be done booting 'grml tohd=/dev/sda1' or
                                    running 'rsync -a --progress /live/image/live /media/sda1/'
grml bootfrom=removable             Restrict search for the live media to removable type only.
grml bootfrom=removable-usb         Restrict search for the live media to usb mass storage only.
grml isofrom=/dev/sda1/grml.iso     Use specified ISO image for booting
                                    Useful when booting as a rescue system from harddisk - just boot
                                    the according grml kernel and initrd using the bootoptions
                                    "boot=live isofrom=/dev/sda1/grml.iso"
                                    Notice: "fromiso" does the same as "isofrom", it's just there
                                    to prevent any typing errors
grml findiso=/grml_2010.12.iso      Look for the specified ISO file on all disks where it usually
                                    looks for the .squashfs file (so you don't have to know the device name
                                    as in isofrom=....).
grml fetch=$IP/filename.squashfs    Download a squashfs image from a given url, copying to ram and booting it.
                                    [Note: releases before 2011.05 didn't support DNS but IP only.]
grml live-media-path=/live/grml...  Sets the path to the live filesystem on the medium
                                    By default, it is set to /live/$GRML_FLAVOUR/ (where $GRML_FLAVOUR
                                    is corresponding to grml64-full, grml32-full, grml64-small,...
                                    [Note: this option is mandatory since release 2011.12]
grml nostats                        Don't send any information to the Grml project at startup.
                                    Parameters sent are Grml version, if the cpu supports 64bit,
                                    anonymized boot parameters and boot source (remote or local).
                                    [Note: only available since release 2011.12]
grml module=grml                    Instead of using the default "$name.module" another file can
                                    be specified without the extension ".module"; it should be placed
                                    on "/live" directory of the live medium
                                    Useful for Multiboot USB pen, see
                                    http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=tips#multiboot_usb_pen
grml bootid=mybootid                Use specified argument as identifier for the ISO.
                                    mybootid is specified in /conf/bootid.txt on the ISO.
                                    [Note: only available since release 2010.04]
grml ignore_bootid                  Disable bootid verification.

grml gcc=3.4 gpp=3.4                Link /usr/bin/gcc, /usr/bin/cpp and /usr/bin/c++ to specified version
grml startx{=windowmanager}         Start X window system automatically
                                    Default window manager (if not provided): wm-ng (wrapper around fluxbox)
grml nostartx                       If using startx as default bootoption the nostartx *disables* automatic
                                    startup of X again. (This bootoption is relevant for grml based derivatives
                                    which decide to enable startx by default only, plain grml does not use
                                    automatic startup of X by default.)
grml vnc=password                   Start VNC server with startup of X.org and sets the password to the specified
                                    one. To automatically start the VNC server use the startx bootoption.
                                    [Note: Grml 2011.12+ doesn't include a VNC server.]
grml vnc_connect=host[:port]        Connect to a listening VNC client ("vncviewer -listen" reverse connection).
                                    Can be used to connect from devices behind firewalls as connection is
                                    initiated from the VNC server instead of the VNC client. Has to be
                                    combined with the vnc bootoption.
                                    [Note: Grml 2011.12+ doesn't include a VNC client.]

Installation related settings:
------------------------------

Caution: do *NOT* use the debian2hd bootoption if you do not know what you are doing!

Install plain Debian via debian2hd bootoption (which runs grml-debootstrap in non-interactive mode):

debian2hd <options>                 ... whereas valid options for debian2hd are:

  target=       target partition/directory of the new Debian system, e.g.: target=/dev/sda1
  grub=         where to install grub to, e.g.: grub=/dev/sda
  release=      specify release of new Debian system (default is stable), e.g.: release=sid
  mirror=       specify mirror for apt-get/aptitude, e,g.: mirror=http://cdn.debian.net/debian
  password=     set passwort of user root without prompting for it, e.g.: password=AiTh5ahn

  Usage example for automatic installation:

    debian2hd target=/dev/sda1 grub=/dev/sda mirror=http://cdn.debian.net/debian password=foobar

  See http://grml.org/grml-debootstrap/ for more information.

Additional notes:
-----------------

*) If your Grml-CD makes strange noises during boot, or you see frequent
errors like "squashfs: read error", or programs are crashing randomly,
then your CD image is probably defective or incomplete, your CD-burner
created a defective CD due to wrong writing speed or bad media or your
CD-ROM drive is broken. This is the most common error reported.  Please
boot with "grml testcd" to check if the CD is OK, and/or even better,
verify the MD5 checksums that are present on the mirrors before writing
the CD.  Check your CD low-level via running 'readcd -c2scan
dev=/dev/cdrom'. In some cases, defective IDE controllers cause this
error if you have DMA enabled. Also, please read the grml-FAQ.

*) In case of a failing hardware autodetection, try booting with any of
the "no-" options as shown in the table above, like in
   grml noagp noapic acpi=off nodma
to skip some critical parts of the autodetection system.

*) Some boards (especially those with E-ISA slots) apparently don't pass
the proper memory size to the linux-kernel. It may cause the message
"Panic: cannot mount root file system" and the system hangs. Use "grml
mem=128M" to solve that problem if your system has 128MByte memory for
example (caution: you MUST use a capital "M" here).

*) The "myconfig=/dev/partition" option allows you to reconfigure the
system after autoconfiguration by running a bourne shell script called
"grml.sh" and/or extracting configuration files from a file named
config.tbz from the root directory on the given device (or floppy).
Take a look at http://grml.org/config/ for more information regarding
the configuration framework of grml.

*) If you wish to remaster the CD, please don't forget to specify

        -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
        -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat

as option to mkisofs. Otherwise your CD won't be bootable. The
directory live, containing the squashfs compressed filesystem file,
must be located in the top level directory of the CD.

*) Caution: screensavers: Don't start vlock or any other screensaver
that requires a password manually. There are no default passwords on
the live system - all accounts are LOCKED by default for security reasons.
Instead just invoke the script grml-lock which prompts for setting a
password.

      CHEATCODES AND HINTS FOR GRML
==============================================================================

*IMPORTANT NOTICE*: Some bootoptions may not work as expected (and documented) yet
                    because grml is based on a new framework named grml-live now - see
                    http://grml.org/grml-live/ for details. Please report all bootoptions
                    that do not work as expected. Thank you! http://grml.org/bugs/

These options (can be combined) work from the (isolinux/grub) bootprompt:

grml                                Use default settings (same as just pressing return)
grml2ram                            Copy grml's squashfs file to RAM and
                                    run from there (compare with 'grml toram')
memtest                             Run Memtest86+ instead of Linux
fb1280x1024                         Use fixed framebuffer graphics (1)
fb1024x768                          Use fixed framebuffer graphics (2) [notice: grml's default]
fb800x600                           Use fixed framebuffer graphics (3)
nofb                                Disable framebuffer
floppy                              Boot from floppydisk
hd / hd1 / hd2 / hd3                Boot from (local) primary / secondary /... harddisk
failsafe                            Boot with (almost) no HW-detection
debug                               Get shells during process of booting for debugging
bootchart                           Create chart of booting sequence in /var/log/bootchart.tgz
forensic                            Do not touch any harddisks during hardware recognition
serial                              Activate ttyS0 and start mgetty
dos                                 Boot FreeDOS
grub                                Boot into the Grub bootloader
qemu                                Boot with special options for use in Qemu
vmware                              Boot with special options for use in VMware

Important: if you notice any problems with one of the
following options please report it to the grml-team:
http://grml.org/bugs/

                                    given distri name can be found in directory desktop on the ISO
				    (/cdrom/desktop/"$DISTRI") it will be taken as wallpaper for grml

Installation related settings:
------------------------------

Caution: do *not* use the grml2hd and/or debian2hd bootoption if you do not know what you are doing!

Install plain Debian via debian2hd bootoption (which runs grml-debootstrap in non-interactive mode):

debian2hd <options>                 ... whereas valid options for debian2hd are:

  target=       target partition/directory of the new Debian system, e.g.: target=/dev/hda1
  grub=         where to install grub to? Use grub syntax for specifying, e.g.: grub=hd0
  groot=        specify root device for usage in grub (use grub syntax), e.g.: groot=hd0,0
  release=      specify release of new Debian system (default is stable), e.g.: release=sid
  mirror=       specify mirror for apt-get/aptitude, e,g.: mirror=ftp://ftp.tugraz.at/mirror/debian
  password=     set passwort of user root without prompting for it, e.g.: password=AiTh5ahn

  Usage example for automatic installation:
    debian2hd target=/dev/hda1 grub=hd0 groot=hd0,0 mirror=ftp://ftp.tugraz.at/mirror/debian password=foobar

  See http://grml.org/grml-debootstrap/ for more information.

Install grml via grml2hd bootoption (which runs grml2hd in non-interactive mode):

grml2hd <options>                   ... whereas valid options for grml2hd are:

   user=                user name for user which should be used at hd-install
   filesystem={ext2|ext3|reiserfs|reiser4|jfs|xfs}      filesystem to be used
   mbr=/dev/...  partition where MBR should be installed (default:=partition)
   partition=/dev/...                partition where grml should be installed

  Usage example for booting:
   grml2hd partition=/dev/hda4 mbr=/dev/hda filesystem=ext3 user=mika

  Passwords of user root and user are "grml" - please adjust after hd-install!

  See http://grml.org/grml2hd/ for more information.

Additional notes:
-----------------

*) Try "grml pci=irqmask=0x0e98" if (you have a notebook and) your
PS/2 mouse doesn't work. (Possibly caused by a BIOS-flaw on your board,
BIOS updates can help.) Sometimes, switching to the text console with
Control-Alt-F1 and back to the X-screen with Control-Alt-F7 solves the
problem without rebooting, since the X server reinitializes the mouse
driver during that procedure.

*) Bootfrom needs access to a running grml-System with the same Kernel
as the Bootkernel, before it is able to mount the partition / ISO-Image.
This should allow a poor mans install from NTFS-Partitions and makes it
also possible to boot an ISO-Image directly. You can also use wildcards
in the ISO-Filename, but it must be unique. So: If you have just one
grml.iso on /dev/hda1 you can access it as: bootfrom=/dev/hda1/G*.iso,
but if there are several, you need to make clear, which one you want.
(Feature added by Fabian Franz.)

*) If your grml-CD makes strange noises during boot, or you see frequent
errors like "squashfs: read error", or programs are crashing randomly,
then your CD image is probably defective or incomplete, or your CD-burner
created a defective CD due to wrong writing speed or bad media. This is
the most common error reported.  Please boot with "grml testcd" to check
if the CD is OK, and/or even better, verify the MD5 checksums that are
present on the mirrors before writing the CD.  Check your CD low-level
via running 'readcd -c2scan dev=/dev/cdrom'. In some cases, defective
IDE controllers cause this error if you have DMA enabled. Also, please
read the grml-FAQ.

*) In case of a failing hardware autodetection, try booting with any of
the "no-" options as shown in the table above, like in
   grml noagp noapm noapic acpi=off nodma
to skip some critical parts of the autodetection system.

*) Some boards apparently don't pass the proper memory size to the
linux-kernel. It may cause the message "Panic: cannot mount root file
system" and the system hangs. Use "grml mem=128M" to solve that
problem if your system has 128MByte memory for example (caution:
you MUST use a capital "M" here).

*) The "myconfig=/dev/partition" option allows you to reconfigure the
system after autoconfiguration by running a bourne shell script called
"grml.sh" and/or extracting configuration files from a file named
config.tbz from the root directory on the given device (or floppy).
Take a look at http://grml.org/config/ for more information regarding
the configuration framework of grml.

*) If you wish to remaster the CD, please don't forget to specify

        -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
        -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat

as option to mkisofs. Otherwise your CD won't be bootable. The
directory GRML, containig the compressed filesystem file "GRML",
must be located in the top level directory of the CD.

*) Caution: screensavers: Don't start xlock/vlock or any other screensaver
that requires a password. There are no default passwords on grml,
i.e. all accounts are LOCKED unless you explicitly set a password.
See also README_Security.txt about this issue.
Hint: If you accidentially started a screensaver switch to one of the
textconsoles by Control-Alt-F1 and kill the screensaver (or just set a
password for the grml user). Take a look at the script grml-lock.

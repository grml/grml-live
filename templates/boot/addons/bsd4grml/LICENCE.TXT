NAME
     This is the BSD-Licence for the MirOS bsd4grml system.

DESCRIPTION
     This document provides a list of all advertising clauses required to be
     reproduced when distributing MirOS, as well as the terms and conditions
     covering the operating system.

MIROS PROJECT
     MirOS is Copyright (C) 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009
           The MirOS Project <miros-dev@mirbsd.org>
     and its contributors.

     It is available under the terms listed below. We strive to make MirOS
     available on OSD conformant licences and believe that it is DFSG free.
     This subset included with grml certainly is.

MirOS' origins
     MirBSD is Copyright (C) 1999, 2002, 2003 ff.
           Thorsten "mirabilos" Glaser <tg@mirbsd.de>
     All rights reserved.

     Provided that these terms and disclaimer and all copyright notices are
     retained or reproduced in an accompanying document, permission is granted
     to deal in this work without restriction, including unlimited rights to
     use, publicly perform, distribute, sell, modify, merge, give away, or
     sublicence.

     Where legally impermissible the licensor does not disclaim liability for
     direct physical injury or death caused solely by defects in the work un-
     less it is modified by a third party.

     This work is provided "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind, to the
     utmost extent permitted by applicable law, neither express nor implied;
     without malicious intent or gross negligence. In no event may a licensor,
     author or contributor be held liable for indirect, direct, other damage,
     loss, or other issues arising in any way out of dealing in the work, even
     if advised of the possibility of such damage or existence of a defect,
     except proven that it results out of said person's immediate fault when
     using the work as intended.

     This licence agreement shall be governed in all aspects by the law of
     Germany; designated place of court is Bonn, NRW, Germany.
     (Gerichtsstand ist Bonn, NRW/Deutschland. Es gilt deutsches Recht.)

     I as the MirOS Project leader and MirBSD's owner hereby assert a
     collective-work copyright on "MirBSD" including the MirPorts Framework
     and the (OpenBSD-derived) kernel and userland, as well as the MirOS Port-
     able Subprojects (for example, mksh, MirMake and jupp), but excluding
     single ports, the contributed sections (the modules gcc, x11 and contrib)
     and any part of MirBSD with copyright assignments in place (appropriate
     CVS access control ought to be set). Please note that this copyright
     still applies to some work contained within the X11 and contrib modules.

NON-BSD SOFTWARE
     MirOS aggregates third-party work, which is owned by their respective au-
     thors and covered by their respective licences (Sendmail, Apache, LGPL,
     GPL). In this edition, the e3 editor (GPLv2) and the tinyirc IRC client
     (GPLv1) are aggregated on the rescue kernel. Their sources accompany this
     document, as demanded by the GNU GPL. The tinyirc author has agreed for
     it to be crunched into the instbin binary; full source code for the other
     binaries and libraries linked is available from our CVS repository.

 If you can't boot the Grml system, don't despair! The Grml team is ready      
 to help you! We are especially interested in hearing about startup            
 problems, because in general they don't happen to only one person.            
 We've either already heard about your particular problem and can              
 dispense a quick fix, or we would like to hear about it and work through      
 it with you, and the next user who comes up with the same problem will        
 profit from your experience!

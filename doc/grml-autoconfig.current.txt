Behavior in current Grml versions
---------------------------------

This section applies to all Grml versions newer than release 2009.05.

The central concept of grml-autoconfig is the DCS directory which holds debs,
configuration and scripts which are used during system startup.

Determination of DCS directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DCS directory defaults to the root directory of the GRML live image. If a
file system labeled GRMLCFG is found, the DCS directory is the root directory of
that file system. Alternatively, the myconfig boot parameter can be used to
directly specify a device which is then taken as DCS directory
(myconfig=/dev/sda1, for example).

Without any additional boot parameters, the GCA at DCSDIR/config.tbz is
automatically unpacked and DCSDIR/scrips/grml.sh is automatically executed on
system startup. The 'noautoconfig' boot parameter disables this automatic
behavior.

Boot Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following boot parameters are supported. Use them at the (isolinux)
bootprompt as documented here.

myconfig::

   This parameter directly sets DCSDIR to the root directory of the specified
   device. Usage examples:

  myconfig=/dev/sda1                        => read DCS from usb-device
  myconfig=/dev/fd0                         => read DCS from floppy-disk

home::

    This parameter is for setting a specific partition as home directory.  Usage
    examples:

  home=/dev/sda3    =>  use /dev/sda3 as the homepartition
  home=scan         =>  scan through the available partitions and search
                        for file grml.img

partconf::

    This parameter mounts the specified device in read-only mode and tries to
    copy all files specified in /etc/grml/partconf to the Grml system. This
    provides the possibility to use the configuration of a harddisk
    installation. For example using the network configuration (which is
    specified in /etc/network) is possible using this boot parameter. Usage
    example:

  partconf=/dev/sda2 => try to mount /dev/sda2 and copy files specified
                        in /etc/grml/partconf to the booted Grml system

netconfig::

    Use this parameter to restore configuration using wget to download a GCA
    from the specified destination. You can also add variables to change the
    file name depending on the host configuration. Predefined and useful
    variables are $ARCH, $HOSTNAME and $KERNEL. Usage example:

  netconfig=server.tld/path/to/config.tbz  =>   restore configuration using wget to download file config.tbz
  netconfig=server.tld/config-$ARCH.tbz    =>   download config for specified architecture

netscript::
    Use this parameter to download and run a script from specified destination:
    You can also add variables to change the file name depending on the host
    configuration. Predefined and useful variables are $ARCH, $HOSTNAME and
    $KERNEL. Usage example:

  netcript=server.tld/path/to/script       =>   download and run script/executable from server
  netscript=server.tld/script-$HOSTNAME    =>   download and run script/executable for specific host

extract::

    Extract specific directories from the GCA which needs to be specified by
    other means.

  extract=/home/grml         => extract only /home/grml from archive
  extract=/etc               => extract only /etc from archive
  extract=/home/grml/config  => extract only $HOME/config from archive

scripts::

    This parameter executes scripts. If an optional path is given, it is
    relative to DCSDIR. If it points to a directory, all scripts inside this
    directory are executed. If the path points to a file, this single file is
    executed. If no path is given, it defaults to scripts/grml.sh. Usage
    examples:

  scripts               =>   run script DCSDIR/scripts/grml.sh
  scripts=foobar.sh     =>   run script foobar.sh in DCSDIR
  scripts=foobar        =>   run all scripts inside DCSDIR/foobar directory

config::

    This parameter restores a configuration using a GCA. If an optional path is
    given, it is relative to DCSDIR. If no path is given, it defaults to
    DCSDIR/config.tbz. Usage examples:

  config                    =>   restore configuration using file DCSDIR/config.tbz
  config=config_foobar.tbz  =>   restore configuration using file DCSDIR/config_foobar.tbz

debs::

    This parameter allows automatic installation of deb packages while booting.
    The path is relative to DCSDIR, not optional and is a shell wildcard. All
    Files matching the wildcard are installed in a single dpkg --install call.
    For backwards compatibility, if no slash is contained in the path, it is
    taken relative to DCSDIR/debs.

    Usage examples:

  debs=*.deb        =>   install all debian packages (suffix .deb) from directory DCSDIR/debs/
  debs=foo/01*.deb  =>   install all debian packages (suffix .deb) starting with 01 in the filename from directory DCSDIR/foo

debnet::

    Search all local partitions and dm devices for file /etc/network/interfaces and
    copy the directory /etc/network to the grml system and restart networking.

noautoconfig::

    Deactivate automounting. By default the scripts try to mount a device with
    label 'GRMLCFG'. If you specify the noautoconfig bootparam this automounting
    will be deactivated.

  noautoconfig            => disables auto mounting of label 'GRMLCFG'


Permanently adjust boot parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you probably know you can adjust boot parameters on the bootprompt.  You want
to set some boot parameters permanently? That's possible via adding a directory
named 'bootparams' to the Grml ISO which has to be located at the root-directory
/bootparams/ (note: the directory is known as /live/image/bootparams/ on a
_running_ Grml system then). Place a textfile inside the directory containing
the boot parameters which should be appended to default ones (this corresponds
to booting without any special parameters).

  mkdir bootparams
  echo lang=de > bootparams/my_bootparams

Then burn a multisession CD where directory bootparams is located in the root
directory of the CD.

[NOTE]
Not all boot parameters can be used via /bootparams/. This is a limitation of
the way the kernel and userspace retrieve boot parameters. Boot parameter
regarding the kernel definitely do *NOT* work. Boot parameter related to
grml-autoconfig (the main part of the boot process in Grml running in userspace,
being all the stuff after startup of udev) are expected to work. Boot parameter
related to initrd/initramfs (the part between 'Searching for GRML file' and
startup of udev) are *NOT* covered by /bootparams/ as well yet.

TIP: the application k3b (not available on the live-CD but available through the
Debian repositories) provides an easy to use interface for doing the
multisession task.

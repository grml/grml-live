# NOTE: as of grml-live v0.44.0 we switched from isc-dhcp-client to dhcpcd.
# But cloud-init has a hard dependency on isc-dhcp-client (at least as of
# v21.4-2 and up and until incl. v23.2.1-1). To ensure that GRML_FULL also
# works on bookworm OOTB and we can ship cloud-init, we enable the switch
# towards dhcpcd only for Debian trixie/testing and newer. Also see
# https://bugs.debian.org/1051421 and

dhcpcd-base

# Required for ping to work in trixie and newer.
